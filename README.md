# SQL Database for Human Resources Template

This project is divided into 3 parts: Data modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. 

## Data Modeling: 

I built an Entity Relationship Diagram after engineering the tables together using the correct primary and foreign keys.

## Data Engineering

I successfully created a table schema for each of 6 CSV files. The tables were created in the correct order to handle foreign keys.

## Data Analysis: 

From these schemas, I was able to conduct further anlysis, including: specific hiring dates, manager profiling, specific name discovery, sales department cataloging, and frequency counts.
